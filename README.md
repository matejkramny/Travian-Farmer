Travian Auto-Farm list
======================

Auto-executes your farm list on your travian account. Currently what it does is it logs in periodically (or re-uses cookies from a previous session), switches to your first village and executes the first full list..

Install `node.js` on your machine and install the dependencies using `npm install`. Then add your travian credentials into `app.js` and just launch the instance using `node app.js`. That is it!
